# Usage
- `image_op.c` : image processing function implement here.
- `main.c` : using #define macro to choose which code section should execute.

# Run
- `make` : get the original data structure (RGBTRIPLE) to operate.
- `make split` : get the split data structure (r,g,b) to operate.
- `make gau_blur_tri` : get the split data and do 5x5 gaussian blur implementation.
